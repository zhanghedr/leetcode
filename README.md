## Leetcode
My Java solutions for [LeetCode Online Judge](https://leetcode.com/) problems. Code is tested in OJ. Time and space are optimized. I am still migrating my solutions from leetcode to github.

The solutions are mostly based on my own implementations and also ideas from [LeetCode discuss forum](https://discuss.leetcode.com/).

Question is commented for each problem.

## TODO
- Add more problems
- Add time and space complexities
